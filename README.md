VITYARTHI PYTHON PROJECT

Overview
Welcome to the VITYARTHI PYTHON PROJECT!
This is a beginner-friendly Machine Learning project that explores and classifies the famous Iris dataset using Python.

The Iris dataset contains 150 samples from three species of Iris flowers:

- Iris setosa
- Iris versicolor
- Iris virginica

Each sample has four features:

- Sepal length
- Sepal width
- Petal length
- Petal width

This project demonstrates a complete data science pipeline: data loading, exploration, visualization, and classification modeling.
Perfect for students ("Vityarthi" = student in Hindi) learning Python and Machine Learning!

Key Features

- Data analysis using Pandas
- Beautiful visualizations with Matplotlib and Seaborn
- Classification models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, etc.)
- Easy-to-follow Jupyter Notebook format
- High accuracy results (approximately 95–100%)

Installation

1. Clone the repository
   git clone https://github.com/ritu25mib10064-pixel/VITYARTHIPYTHONPROJECT.git
   cd VITYARTHIPYTHONPROJECT

2. Create a virtual environment (recommended)
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

3. Install required packages
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   (or)
   pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn jupyter

4. Start Jupyter Notebook
   jupyter notebook

Usage

1. Open the file: iris_analysis.ipynb
2. Run all cells step by step
3. You will see:
   - Dataset summary and statistics
   - Correlation heatmap
   - Scatter plots, pair plots, box plots
   - Model training and accuracy scores
   - Clear separation of species in visualizations

Expected Result: Model achieves 95%+ accuracy in classifying Iris species.
